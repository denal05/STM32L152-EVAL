 @par Directory contents
 
 - project .cproject/.project: A pre-configured project file with the provided 
                               library structure that produces an executable 
                               image with TrueSTUDIO.

 - stm32_flash.ld:             This file is the TrueSTUDIO linker script used to 
                               place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH 
                               and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal 
                               SRAM. 
                               You can customize this file to your need.
                           
 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
 - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace 
   directory.
 - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
   and then click "Next". 
 - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory and select the project: 
   - STM32L152-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power 
     Medium-density devices
     @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32L1XX_MD, USE_STM32L152_EVAL
 - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
   window then click on Project->build project menu.
 - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
   Run->Debug (F11)

@note
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices are STM32L151xx and STM32L152xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and 
  STM32L162xx microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 256 Kbytes.
- Ultra Low Power High-density devices are STM32L151xx, STM32L152xx and STM32L162xx 
  microcontrollers where the Flash memory density is 384 Kbytes.
